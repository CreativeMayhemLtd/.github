# Creative Mayhem, Ltd.

### Human tools for a post-platform world

Creative Mayhem is a hybrid consultancy, studio, and lab building systems that keep people connected to meaning, value, and each other in an age dominated by automation. We create **human-scale infrastructure** for a world that’s scaling away from people.

## What we've built, our offering:

### [Sortalizer](https://sortalizer.com)

**Sortalizer is a "storage-locker-arbitrage" tool** that is built as a privacy-first, coin-operated AI pipeline. It identifies items, finds sold listings, and writes SEO-optimized descriptions in seconds using five distinct AIs and live market data. It is a neural upgrade designed to collapse the research phase so you can stop researching and start selling.

Turn your doom piles into cash, Sortalizer exports results in many formats including specific online-markets and **XLS, CSV, JSON, PDF, and HTML**, giving you control over your inventory from a photo.

Built on the [Framework](https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/Framework) platform.

### NSFW as a Service: The Firewall for Your Eyeballs

A coin-operated private-label AI API pipeline for systems that cannot afford ambiguity. Built to ensure users are not sending prohibited content to upstream commercial providers, this service provides high-velocity content classification for the discerning operator. It is designed for platforms that demand consistent results, total operational control, and clean integration into existing pipelines. No public endpoints, no shared models, and no drama—just a bulletproof gatekeeper that stops bad data before it contaminates your environment. Serious Private Inquires only [info@creativemayhem.ltd](mailto:info@creativemayhem.ltd)    

Used in [Sortalizer.com](https://sortalizer.com) and other products
Built on the [Framework](https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/Framework) platform.

### [Memescreamer_Hotdog_NotHotdog](https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/memescreamer_Hotdog_NotHotdog)

**The Engine.** The open-source core of our NSFW as a Service in 'host it yourself' format. A CLIP-based image and video filter that flags NSFW content and runs locally. It uses either a rules-based policy or a user-trained classifier to give you total sovereignty over your ingest and generative media workflows. It supports batch processing, GPU acceleration, and video frame sampling, providing a heavy-duty safety layer without relying on external services.

Used in the Memescreamer - [Doomscroll.fm](https://doomscroll.fm) and [Sortalizer.com](https://sortalizer.com) products

### [Memescreamer](https://memescreamer.com)

An experimental AI media engine that turns the daily noise of the internet into autonomous broadcast. Each episode is generated from real headlines and social flux, creating narrative, voice, and music through machine collaboration. Proof of product capability at **[Doomscroll.fm](https://doomscroll.fm)**.

### [Framework](https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/Framework)

**The Foundation.** Framework is the underlying substrate for just about every product we run. It is a battle-tested SaaS container pattern for deploying industrial-scale digital products. It provides a secure, "six-walled" infrastructure with pre-built modules for authentication, credit-based economies, GDPR compliance, and deep observability. Framework handles the heavy lifting of operations—job queues, billing, and safety. Framework enables rapid deployment of secure, private, and scalable platforms without reinventing the foundation.

## Our Philosophy

Humans will need independent, peer-to-peer systems to survive in B2AI economies. Creative Mayhem builds those systems; practical tools for communication, entertainment, exchange, and creative resilience.

We design for clarity, autonomy, and endurance. Our work favors small, local, inspectable tools over opaque networks. What matters is keeping human circuits alive and generative, not nostalgic.

---

## Security and Integrity

Security is not a feature, but it is a condition. A system remains secure only while it’s observable, understandable, and within human control. We build with privacy, minimal data, and independence in mind.

**Our principles:**

* **Transparency:** Trust comes from visibility and comprehension.
* **Autonomy:** Control belongs to the operator, not the vendor.
* **Resilience:** Systems should serve human intent, even under stress or failure.

Security, for us, is not a static goal but a living relationship between people and their tools.
