# Creative Mayhem.

### Human tools for a post-platform world

Creative Mayhem is a hybrid consultancy, studio, and lab building systems that keep people connected to meaning, value, and each other in an age dominated by automation. We create **human-scale infrastructure** for a world that’s scaling away from people.

## What we've built:

### [OpenGIO](https://OpenGIO.com)

**Generative Information Ontology. One AI's answer is marketing. Four AIs diverging is signal.**

OpenGIO queries four major LLM providers simultaneously (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI) and maps how each perceives and represents topics across 75+ semantic attributes in 3D semantic space. When providers agree, that's consensus. When they fragment, that's the story.

## What it does

- Simultaneous multi-provider LLM analysis across 40+ semantic attributes
- 45+ analytical lenses (Ikigai, Ubuntu, Kintsugi, Monomyth, and more)
- DSM-5 psychometric calibration of each provider before measurement
- Daily drift tracking with variance thresholds (V_MAX) that flag narrative fragmentation
- Correlation engine against GDELT news volume and market volume.
- 3D semantic visualization via Three.js

## Status

Closed beta.

## The point

Humans, Businesses, and Regulators are arguing about AI bias with anecdotes. We measure it. Daily. Across providers. With math, providing actionable information.

### [Sortalizer](https://sortalizer.com)

**Sortalizer is a "storage-locker-arbitrage" tool** that is built as a privacy-first, coin-operated AI pipeline. It identifies items, finds sold listings, and writes SEO-optimized descriptions in seconds using five distinct AIs and live market data. It is a neural upgrade designed to collapse the research phase so you can start selling.

Turn your doom piles into cash, Sortalizer exports results in many formats including specific online-markets and **XLS, CSV, JSON, PDF, and HTML**, giving you control over your inventory from a photo.

Built on the [Framework](https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/Framework) platform.  | [Sortalizer Issue Tracker](https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/Sortalizer)

### [Not/Safe For Work as a Service:](https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/NSFWaaS):  The Firewall for Your Eyeballs

[Not/Safe For Work as a Service](https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/NSFWaaS)  A private-label AI API pipeline for systems that cannot afford ambiguity. Built on a tailor made ICP-Proxy-Like Architecture, this service ensures a cryptographically verifiable buffer between high-risk AI generation and your corporate environment. It is designed for platforms that demand consistent results, total operational control, and absolute privacy through decentralized gateways. No public endpoints, no direct IP exposure, and no drama. Just a bulletproof, zero-knowledge gatekeeper that stops bad data before it contaminates your environment.

The ICP Advantage
Zero-Knowledge Filtering: Decentralized canisters verify content before it ever touches your local network, breaking the chain of custody for prohibited material before it affects your risk appetite.
Decentralized Proxy: Hides your industrial infrastructure behind a cryptographically secured layer, making master libraries impossible to scrape or trace.
Genuine Deniability: Provides a "bleached" data stream to consumers, ensuring the enterprise never "possesses" the raw, liability-inducing data.

Used in Sortalizer.com and other products.

Built on the Framework platform.

### [Memescreamer_Hotdog_NotHotdog](https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/memescreamer_Hotdog_NotHotdog)

**The Engine.** The open-source core of our N/SFW as a Service in 'host it yourself' and untrained format. A CLIP-based image and video filter that flags NSFW content and runs locally. Use either a rules-based policy or a user-trained classifier to give yourself total sovereignty over your ingest and generative media workflows. It supports batch processing, GPU acceleration, and video frame sampling, providing a high-velocity safety layer without relying on external commercial services. Please read license agreement prior to commerical use.

Used in Memescreamer and the [Doomscroll.fm](https://doomscroll.fm) for both ingest and output, and [Sortalizer.com](https://sortalizer.com) image ingest analysis.

### [Memescreamer](https://memescreamer.com)  A live, autonomous media and inference pipeline that stress-tests generative systems under real-world load, policy pressure, and failure conditions.

An autonomous AI media and inference engine that converts live internet signal into continuous broadcast. It ingests real headlines and social flux, then generates narrative, voice, music, and video through fully automated orchestration.

Memescreamer operates at production scale, not demo scale. It runs continuously on local or API inference, publishes thousands of segments, and exposes real failure modes across generation, moderation, cost control, latency, and platform compliance.

Public proof of operation is available at [Doomscroll.fm](https://doomscroll.fm)

### [Framework](https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/Framework)

**The Foundation.** Framework is the underlying substrate for just about every product we run. It is a battle-tested SaaS container pattern for deploying industrial-scale digital products. It provides a secure, "six-walled" infrastructure with pre-built modules for authentication, credit-based economies, GDPR/EUAI-Act/other compliance factors, and deep observability. Framework handles the heavy lifting of operations—job queues, billing, and safety. Framework enables rapid deployment of secure, private, and scalable platforms without reinventing the foundation.

## Our Philosophy

Humans will need independent, peer-to-peer systems to survive in B2AI economies. Creative Mayhem builds those systems; practical tools for communication, entertainment, exchange, and creative resilience.

We design for clarity, autonomy, and endurance. Our work favors small, local, inspectable tools over opaque networks. What matters is keeping human circuits alive and generative, not nostalgic.

---

## Security and Integrity

Security is not a feature, but it is a condition. A system remains secure only while it’s observable, understandable, and within human control. We build with privacy, minimal data, and independence in mind.

**Our principles:**

* **Transparency:** Trust comes from visibility and comprehension.
* **Autonomy:** Control belongs to the operator, not the vendor.
* **Resilience:** Systems should serve human intent, even under stress or failure.

Security, for us, is not a static goal but a living relationship between people and their tools.
