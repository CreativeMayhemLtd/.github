# Creative Mayhem, Ltd.

### Human tools for a post-platform world

Creative Mayhem is a hybrid consultancy, studio, and lab building systems that keep people connected to meaning, value, and each other in an age dominated by automation.  

We create **human-scale infrastructure** for a world that’s scaling away from people — tools for those who still want to make, trade, play, and communicate.

## What we've built, our offering:

### [Memescreamer](https://memescreamer.com)
An experimental media engine that turns the daily noise of the internet into autonomous broadcast.  
Each episode is generated from real headlines and social flux, creating narrative, voice, and music through machine collaboration.  
Proof of concept at [**Doomscroll.fm**](https://doomscroll.fm)

#### [Framework](https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/Framework)
A battle-tested SaaS container pattern for deploying industrial-scale digital products. It provides a secure, "six-walled" infrastructure with pre-built modules for authentication, credit-based economies, GDPR compliance, and deep observability. Framework handles the heavy lifting of operations—job queues, billing, and safety—enabling the rapid deployment of secure, private, and scalable platforms without reinventing the foundation.

### [memescreamer_Hotdog_NotHotdog](https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/memescreamer_Hotdog_NotHotdog)
Hotdog_NotHotDog is a CLIP-based image and video filter that flags NSFW content as NSFW. It runs locally, using either a rules-based policy or a user-trained RandomForest classifier on top of CLIP features. It supports batch processing, GPU acceleration, video frame sampling, and optional auto-tuning to optimize threshold settings. The tool offers a safety layer for ingest and generative media workflows without relying on external services.

## Our Philosophy

Humans will need independent, peer-to-peer systems to survive in B2AI economies.  
Creative Mayhem builds those systems — practical tools for communication, entertainment, exchange, and creative resilience.  

We design for clarity, autonomy, and endurance. Our work favors small, local, inspectable tools over opaque networks. What matters is keeping human circuits alive and generative, not nostalgic.

## Security and Integrity

Security is not a feature — it is a condition.  
A system remains secure only while it’s observable, understandable, and within human control.  
We build with privacy, minimal data, and independence in mind.  

**Our principles:**
- **Transparency:** Trust comes from visibility and comprehension.  
- **Autonomy:** Control belongs to the operator, not the vendor.  
- **Resilience:** Systems should serve human intent, even under stress or failure.  

Security, for us, is not a static goal but a living relationship between people and their tools.
